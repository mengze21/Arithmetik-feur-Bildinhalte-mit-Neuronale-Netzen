# nnlib
This is the current version of nnlib, my integrated neural network solution atop Keras.

## Usage
The repository can be cloned and used as a python module. It exposes only the basic interfaces to use load
operations or build new containers. For more advanced stuff, import the files the module consists of themselves.

## Requirements
The current version is built and tested against Tensorflow 2.4 and Python 3.8, but should work with all releases of Tensorflow 2 and Python 2 and 3.
It requires tensorflow, matplotlib and pypng packages to be installed. For full functionality, bpy must additionally be present.
